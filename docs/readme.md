# Overview

The js-kin-base library is the lowest-level Kin helper library. It can be used in a browser or in node.js. It is mainly used to read, create and
sign [transactions](https://stellar.org/developers/learn/concepts/transactions.html). This library is used and exposed by
[js-kin-sdk](https://github.com/kinecosystem/js-kin-sdk) but you can use it by itself if you don't need to communicate with Horizon.
